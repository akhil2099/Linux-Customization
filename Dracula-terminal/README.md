### 🔧 Customization Options

1. **Font styling 🌌:**
   - Open **Terminal Preferences**
   - Select the Dracula profile
   - Uncheck **Use System Font**
   - Choose your favorite font (make it spooky 💀)

2. **Transparency tweaks 🔄:**
   - In Profile preferences
   - Slide the transparency bar (wooosh 💨)
   - Suggested range: 5-15% for eerie perfection

3. **Cursor pizzazz 🔄:**
   - Shapes: Block, I-Beam, Underline
   - Blinking: On/Off (we recommend "off" – Dracula prefers steady gazes 😉)

---

### 🚫 Troubleshooting

If things get... weird (no bats in the belfry, promise):

1. **Reset to the default profile ♻️:**
   ```bash
   dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/
   ```
   *"Back to square one, human."*

2. **Common vampire issues:**
   - Colors appear wrong: Ensure your terminal supports 256 colors (or Dracula gets grumpy 💩)
   - Font issues: Check if the chosen font is installed (or Dracula will send bats to your house 🪇)
   - Script fails: Check write permissions (or offer your soul to fix it 😈).

### 🌐 Maintenance

To keep Dracula updated (he hates being outdated):

1. Go to the repository directory 🏢
2. Pull the latest changes 🎢:
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```
3. Re-run the installation script 💋:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
