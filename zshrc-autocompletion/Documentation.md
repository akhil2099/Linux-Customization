## <a id="customization"></a>Customization 🎨

You can customize **`zsh-autosuggestions`** to fit your unique style! 😎

### 1. Change Highlight Style 🎨

To modify the appearance of suggestions, add the following line to your **`~/.zshrc`** file:

```bash
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=8' 🌈
```

This will change the suggestion color to gray. You can customize it further using standard ANSI color codes. 🎨

### 2. Enable Auto-Accept Suggestions 🕹️

If you want to accept suggestions automatically after a brief delay, add the following to your **`~/.zshrc`** file:

```bash
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT=500  # Accept suggestion after 500 ms ⏱️
```

### 3. Accept Suggestions with the Right Arrow Key → 

Make it easier to accept suggestions by binding the **Right Arrow** key:

```bash
bindkey "^[[C" autosuggest-accept ➡️
```

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting 🛑

If **`zsh-autosuggestions`** isn’t working, don’t panic! Here are some troubleshooting steps to get you back on track. 🛠️

### 1. Verify Plugin Installation 🔍

Check if the plugin is installed by running:

```bash
ls ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Ensure the plugin files are in place. 📂

### 2. Verify Command History 📝

The plugin relies on your **command history**. Check if your history is populated by running:

```bash
history
```

If your history is empty, start typing more commands to build it up. 🚀

### 3. Check for Errors in `.zshrc` ⚠️

Make sure your **`~/.zshrc`** file is correctly configured:

```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions) 🎉
source ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```

After making changes, reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4. Reset Highlight Style 🔄

If suggestions aren't appearing, try removing any custom highlight styles:

```bash
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='' ✨
```

Then reload your shell again:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
