# **Batcat Installation and Configuration Guide** 🎉

This guide will help you install **`batcat`** (the improved version of `cat` with syntax highlighting and other features) and configure your **Zsh** shell to use `batcat` by default instead of `cat`. 🚀

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites 🧰

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A terminal running **Zsh**. 🖥️
- **Homebrew** installed (for macOS or Linux). 💻
- Basic knowledge of editing the **`~/.zshrc`** file. 😎

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation 🛠️

### **1. Install `batcat`**

#### On macOS or Linux using Homebrew:
1. Open your terminal and install `bat` (which is often aliased as `batcat`) via Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install bat
   ```

   This will install `bat`, which you can use with the `batcat` command.

#### On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
1. If you’re using a Debian-based system, you can install `bat` (batcat is the symlink for `bat`):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install bat
   ```

2. If it doesn't install `batcat`, you can manually create the symlink after installing `bat`:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s $(which bat) /usr/local/bin/batcat
   ```

Now you should be able to use `batcat` in the terminal.

### **2. Verify Installation**
After installation, verify that `batcat` works by typing:

```bash
batcat --version
```

You should see the version of **`bat`** displayed.

 ## <a id="configuration"></a>Configuration ⚙️

### **1. Replace `cat` with `batcat` in `~/.zshrc`**

To make `batcat` the default command when you type `cat`, you need to modify your **`~/.zshrc`** file.

1. Open your **`~/.zshrc`** file in your favorite editor:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add an alias for `cat` to point to `batcat`:

   ```bash
   alias cat="batcat"
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor (for nano, press `CTRL + X`, then press `Y` to confirm, and `Enter`).

4. To apply the changes, reload your Zsh configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Now, when you type `cat` in the terminal, it will run `batcat` instead, with syntax highlighting and additional features!

## <a id="customization"></a>Customization 🎨

### **1. Customize `batcat` Style**
You can modify the appearance of `batcat` by adding custom flags or configurations in **`~/.config/bat/config`**. To change the default configuration for `batcat`, you can create or edit the `config` file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/bat
nano ~/.config/bat/config
```

Add custom options, for example:

```bash
--theme="OneHalfDark"
--paging=always
```

This configures `batcat` to use a specific theme and always paginate output.

### **2. Enable Syntax Highlighting for More File Types**
By default, `batcat` supports many file types, but you can add custom language definitions or syntax highlighting. For example, to enable syntax highlighting for additional file types, you can modify the `~/.config/bat/config` file:

```bash
--language=python
--language=html
```

---

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting 🛑

If **`batcat`** isn’t working as expected, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### **1. Verify Installation**
Ensure `batcat` is installed by running:

```bash
which batcat
```

If you don't get a result, you may need to install or link `batcat` properly (check the installation instructions).

### **2. Verify Alias in `~/.zshrc`**
Ensure that the alias is correctly set in your **`~/.zshrc`** file:

```bash
alias cat="batcat"
```

If not, re-add it, save, and source your **`~/.zshrc`** again:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### **3. Check `batcat` Path**
If `batcat` is still not working, check the path of `batcat` by running:

```bash
which batcat
```

If the path is incorrect, ensure that `bat` is installed and properly symlinked.

### **4. Reinstall `bat`**
If everything else fails, you can try reinstalling `bat`:

```bash
brew reinstall bat  # For macOS
sudo apt reinstall bat  # For Ubuntu/Debian
```
